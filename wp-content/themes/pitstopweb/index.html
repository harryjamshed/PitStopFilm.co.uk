      <h2>Aqib Khan as Noveed</h2>
      Aqib had his screen debut in the 2010 film <i>West Is West</i>, the sequel to the 1999 film <i>East Is East</i>.  He was just 15 years old when the film was released and was considered “something of a find” for the film due to his resemblance to actor Jordan Routledge who played the role of Sajid in the original film.  His work on the film received critical acclaim. Since filming, Aqib has gone on to work with some top names in television and film starring alongside Julie Walters in The <i>Jury</i>, and Michael Palin in Remember Me.  He is currently shooting a feature film with Harvey Keitel and Gabriel Byrne in Yorkshire for release next year.
